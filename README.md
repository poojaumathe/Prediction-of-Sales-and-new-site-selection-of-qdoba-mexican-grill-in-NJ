# Prediction-of-Sales-and-new-site-selection-of-qdoba-mexican-grill-in-NJ

In this Project we worked on the prediction of Qdoba Mexican Grill sales and possible new restaurant locations in New Jersey. 
We have used Machine Learning concepts and for modeling we performed Linear Regression for predicting restaurant sales and 
we got pretty good accuracy. 
Also for predicting new location of Qdoba restaurant we have used GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression).
We have used R, Python and Tableau to predict all the results very accurately.

Thank you:)

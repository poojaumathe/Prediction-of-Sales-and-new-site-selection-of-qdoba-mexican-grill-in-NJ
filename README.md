# Prediction-of-Sales-and-new-site-selection-of-qdoba-mexican-grill-in-NJ

In this Project I have predicted 10 potential location of Qudoba mexican grill restaurant in New Jersey.

By using Machine Learning concepts and for modeling I performed Linear Regression for predicting restaurant sales and 
got pretty good accuracy. 

Also for predicting new location of Qdoba restaurant I have used GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression).
For the coding and visualization we used R, Python and Tableau to predict all the results accurately.
